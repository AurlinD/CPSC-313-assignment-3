        0.5 mark for retrieving a 4 byte integer (not only a single byte)


    [/4] Function cache_set_find_matching_line
        1 mark for looping through the cache lines in the set
        1 mark for checking tags and validity of each
        1 mark for calling cache_line_make_mru as appropriate
        1 mark for the correct return values

    [/3] Function find_available_cache_line
        1 mark for returning an invalid (empty) cache line if one exists
        1 mark for returning the least recently used line if all are valid
        1 mark for calling cache_line_make_mru as appropriate

    [/7] Function cache_read
        1 mark for extracting the tag, set index and cache block offsets
        2 marks for handling the case where the data is in the cache
        3 marks for the case where the data is not already in the cache
        1 mark for updating access_count and miss_count

    [/1] Comments and style


[/21] Question 2
----------
         For each part, specifying the miss rate is worth 0.5 marks, and
        explanation is worth 2.5 marks

        [/3] part a.

        [/3] part c.

[/12] Question 3
----------

         [/2] 2 marks, modifications compile and execute, baseline data

         [/4] There should be at least 2 other documented attempts to
              improve performance, they don't have to succeed but the
              rationale needs to be sound. One example would be to
              collapse all the separate sets of loops down into 1
              set. Another would be to change the order of i and j.
	      
	      2 marks for each attempt and rationale to a maximum of 4
